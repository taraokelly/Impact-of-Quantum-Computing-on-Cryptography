@article{Post_Q_Cryptog,
Abstract = {Cryptography is essential for the security of online communication, cars and implanted medical devices. However, many commonly used cryptosystems will be completely broken once large quantum computers exist. Post-quantum cryptography is cryptography under the assumption that the attacker has a large quantum computer; post-quantum cryptosystems strive to remain secure even in this scenario. This relatively young research area has seen some successes in identifying mathematical operations for which quantum algorithms offer little advantage in speed, and then building cryptographic systems around those. The central challenge in post-quantum cryptography is to meet demands for cryptographic usability and flexibility without sacrificing confidence.; },

@article{Q_Alg,
Abstract = {The article discusses progress that has been made in the field of quantum algorithms. In 1994 Peter Schor sparked interest in quantum algorithms with his discovery that they could be used to factor natural numbers and evaluate discrete logarithms. Since then various researchers have explored the power of quantum algorithms. Among topics the authors cover are an introduction to quantum theory, quantum interference and its contribution to efficient algorithms, using quantum algorithms to evaluate NAND tree circuits, and unearthing hidden symmetries.},

@article{Impact_QC_Cryptog,
Abstract = {Quantum computing has been heralded by some as the death of cryptography as we know it. Yet the quantum computers that exist today can't perform more complex operations than tasks such as factoring 15 into 3×5, so they're pretty useless. A useful quantum computer would need to be large and reliable enough to perform operations involving thousands or millions of quantum bits (qubits) in order to break cryptographic algorithms widely used today. Quantum computing has been heralded by some as the death of cryptography, although such machines are still in the early stages of development. We don't yet know how hard it is to build a scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computer, but we should be prepared and understand the real impact of quantum computing on our networks' security. Jean-Philippe Aumasson of Kudelski looks at how quantum computers work, the algorithms that run on them and the potential impact on cryptography.},

@article{PKC,
Abstract = {This chapter discusses recent advancements in cryptographic techniques, known as public key cryptography, which provides elegant solutions not only to secrecy and authentication, but also to protection against forgery through a provision called digital signatures. The chapter begins by introducing a few useful concepts, definitions, and notations. The process of transforming the message or plain text and locking its contents from being known to others is called encryption or enciphering. Decryption is the unlocking of the ciphered text to get back the original plain text. The locking and unlocking is done by a key, which is known only to the legitimate sender-receiver and the encryption-decryption pair constitutes a cryptosystem. Cryptography deals with the analysis and design of cryptosystems. The modern public-key cryptosystem uses different keys for the encryption and decryption process. The chapter presents various algorithms for public key cryptosystems and describes its various },

@article{Impact_QC_Cryptog_1,
Abstract = {The strength of our current encryption systems is based on cryptographic keys and complex mathematical algorithms. Using a sufficiently long cryptographic key, a mathematical algorithm transforms plaintext into ciphertext in such a way as to make it computationally infeasible for a cryptanalyst to determine either the enciphered message or the underlying key. An implicit assumption is that computer technology, as we know it, is used throughout this process. But what if a different type of computer — one based on quantum physics rather than classical mechanics — was used?},

@article{Q_Cryptog,
Abstract = {Most modern cryptographic studies design cryptosystems and algorithms using mathematical concepts. In designing and analyzing cryptosystems and protocols, mathematical concepts are critical in supporting the claim that the intended cryptosystem is secure. Most early cryptographic algorithms are based either on factorization or on discrete logarithm problem. Such systems generally adopt rather simple mathematics, and, therefore, need extensive secondary index computation. This study discusses quantum cryptosystems, protection of system security, and optimization of system efficiency. Quantum cryptography detects intrusion and wiretap. In quantum mechanics, a wiretap is neither external nor passive; rather it modifies its entity based on the internal component of the system. The status of the quantum system changes once a wiretap is detected. Hence, only the designer of the system can discover the quantum status of the system; an eavesdropper can neither determine the quantum state nor },
