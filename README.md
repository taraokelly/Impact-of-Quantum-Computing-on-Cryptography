# The Impact of Quantum Computing on Cryptography

## Abstract

With the arrival of quantum computing, one must acknowledge the security implications. The integrity of many common cryptographic systems, namely discrete logarithm and factoring based systems, are at risk. Examining the pre-quantum state of cryptography, we will discuss the predicted affect of quantum on cryptography. Although there are quantum computers that exist today, all are far from capable of performing operations complex enough to break cyptographic algorithms widely used today. This does not mean an impact has not yet been felt. The threat of quantum computing has already lead to the creation a new cryptographic field - post-quantum crytography. The attempts of this field are in contention with the emerging technology, pursuing to implement a *feasible*, *flexible* and *computationally efficient* solution before a pertinent quantum  computer can be built.
