%\subsection{The Art of Encryption}
\subsection{Introduction to Cryptography}
Cryptography is a method of protecting data from people who are not authorized to see it. Encryption, a significant mechanism in cryptography, is achieved by transforming the plaintext into ciphertext, with the intent of rendering it meaningless to those who do not have the classified resources. With these resources, the ciphertext is usually transformed it back to it's original state, a process called decryption.

Symmetric-key encryption utilizes the same key to both encrypt and decrypt, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) being the prevailing form. Symmetric encryption is more accomplished in achieving a faster outcome than that of asymmetric. Problematically, the sender and the receiver must hold the same key. How do they exchange keys digitally without another party eavesdropping? A typical solution would be to use asymmetric encryption to exchange symmetric keys.

Asymmetric-key encryption (a.k.a. public-key cryptography) practices an encryption technique with two differing, mathematically linked keys. The first key being a public key and the corresponding key being a private key. As implied in it's name, the public key is to be publicized. The private key is to be kept secret. The public key can be used to encrypt data, whereas the homologous private key can be used to decrypt the data. An ideal public-key cryptographic algorithm should serve as a trapdoor function. A trapdoor function is a function that is easy to perform one way, but has a secret that is required to perform the inverse calculation efficiently. The objective is to decrease the probability that the secret could be identified as much as possible.

So far, we have acknowledged AES, RSA and ECC; all can be adopted in pursual of a \textbf{confidential} message. Cryptography is also concerned with proving the \textbf{integrity}, \textbf{authenticity} and \textbf{non-repudiation} of a message e.g. Message Authentication Code (MAC), Digital Signatures. Another method attempting the assurance of integrity could be by hash functions, e.g. Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA).

\subsection{Rivest Shamir Adleman}
 Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) was first publicized in 1978 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman. The RSA algorithm is the most popular and  perhaps the best understood public key cryptography system. RSA's security derives from the difficulty of factoring two large integers and the expeditious multiplication to get these large numbers; it is a befitting example of the ``trapdoor" methodology. 
 
 Two prime numbers, \(p\) and \(q\), are generated. The values \(p\) and \(q\) are multiplied together to get the maximum value, \(n\). A number \(pub\) is selected to be the public key, such that \(pub\) is not a factor of \((p - 1)\) and \((q - 1)\). Then the private key \(priv\) is generated, such that \((priv * pub) mod (p - 1) * (q - 1) = 1\). 
 %The message \(M\) is converted to an integer \(C\) by multiplying itself to the power of the public key, then employs a wrapping scheme to ensure \(C > 0\) and \(C < n\). The decryption is a similar process, the cipher \(C\) is converted to \(M\) by squaring itself to the power of the private key. A wrapping scheme is again implemented, ensuring \(M > 0\) and \(M < n\). 
 As long as you know the values \(p\) and \(q\), you can compute a corresponding private key from this public key, explaining how factoring relates to breaking RSA. Factoring the maximum number into its component primes allows you to compute someone's private key from the public key and decrypt their private messages.

\subsection{Elliptic Curve Cryptography}

Although Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) was originally proposed in 1985 by by Neal Koblitz and Victor S. Miller, it was not widely utilized until the 21st century. It is not as widely understood as RSA, with it's complexity to blame. ECC allows the use of smaller keys than RSA to get the same levels of security. 
%Small keys are very beneficial nowadays, considering cryptography is often implemented on low powered devices, e.g. a mobile phone. While multiplying two prime numbers together is easier, when the prime numbers start to get very long, even just the multiplication step can take some time on a low powered device.

ECC is based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields \cite{RSA_ECC}. ECC handles the following domain parameters: \((p,a,b,G,n,h)\). To briefly explain the parameters, \(p\) is the field that the graph is defined over, the variables \(a\) and \(b\) are values that define the curve, \(G\) is known as the generator point (a.k.a. base point), \(n\) is the prime order of G and \(h\) is the cofactor of the curve.

The private key \(d\) is a randomly selected integer in the interval \( [ 1 , n - 1 ]\). Subsequently, the public key \(Q=dG\). The security of ECC is built upon the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) \cite{RSA_ECC}; ECDLP in ECC applies to the laborious task of locating the discrete logarithm of random elliptic curve element even with a known point. With the given the domain parameters and \(Q\), ECDLP refers to the problem of determining \(d\). In a real world standard application, it would be unfeasible to check all the possibilities of \(d\).
