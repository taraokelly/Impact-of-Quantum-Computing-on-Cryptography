\section{Conclusion}
According to Kudelski there is no need to worry about QC breaking current cryptographic systems for years to come; cryptographers have time to create an optimal solution \cite{Impact_QC_Cryptog}. However, one must also consider the time costs of integration and standardization. It could take companies years blah blah blah.
