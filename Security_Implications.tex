\section{Security Implications of Quantum Computers}
blah

Does not have to have a QC but could be relying on a service provided by another party that has a quantum computer.

\subsection{Shor's Algorithm}

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}



Harmful affects can be seen in Symmetric Encryption.

Searches.
Classical comp. can do a search with the speed of \(O(N)\)

Grover's algorithm suggests that is that can implement the same search in \(O(\sqrt{N}\)) time using quantum queries.

Grover's acceleration from \(O(N)\) to \(O(\sqrt{N}\)) is not quite as calamitous as Shor's.

Affects hashing (SHA-256 and SHA3-256 anyway), and AES.

\subsection{Social Concerns}
Hackers.

Governments:

Citizen Privacy - use NSA's leakage of PRISM program as example. Refer to \cite{Sec_Risk}.
    
Increase Global Tensions by increasing a governments ability to spy on another.
